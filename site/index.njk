    <p class="mb-4">Delivery is available in Fife or you can collect your veg from the farm. This is a great opportunity to explore healthy farmland and our pasture. Feeling and hearing the diversity brought by organic farming and perhaps catching a glimpse of swooping swifts, low over the grasses.</p>
